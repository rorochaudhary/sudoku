# Description: For this project I chose to implement a 9x9 Sudoku solution verifier. The verifier takes as input a user-submitted solution.txt and determines whether solution.txt is a valid solution certifiate according to the rules of Sudoku. solution.py contains a 9x9 multi-dimensional array containing digit values 0-9 (where 0 denotes an empty position).

def check_solution(certificate):
    """iterates over certificate and determines whether certificate is a valid solution according to Sudoku rules: each row, each column, and each non-overlapping 3x3 grid must contain values between 1 and 9"""

    pass
